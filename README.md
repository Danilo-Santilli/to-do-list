# To-Do List

This is a web application that I developed, which has the function of saving tasks, as well as editing and completing them. The application is designed to help users keep track of their tasks and manage them efficiently.

## Live Demo

You can try out the To-Do List application [here](https://to-do-list-danilo.netlify.app/).

## Features

- User Authentication: Users can log in or quickly create an account to access the application.
- Task Management: Users can input tasks to be completed and mark them as complete when done.
- Task Editing: Users can edit their tasks if needed.
- Data Persistence: The application integrates with the Firebase database, ensuring that tasks are saved even if the user exits the application and returns later.

## How to Use

1. Access the application using the provided link.
2. After logging in, you will be directed to the main page of the application, where you can input your tasks to be completed.
3. To edit a task, click on the task you want to edit and make the necessary changes.
4. When you complete a task, click the 'Complete' button to mark it as done.

The application utilizes the Firebase database and authentication system for storing data and managing user accounts.

## Technologies Used

- React JS: Front-end development.
- Firebase: Database and authentication system.
